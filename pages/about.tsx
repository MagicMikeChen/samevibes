              Two Pillars of Javascript

            <div className="indent-8 lg:text-lg">
              I’m lucky to have the experience of using functional programming
              (FP) to refactor the same project written in object-oriented
              programming (OOP) style.
            </div>
            <div className="indent-8 lg:text-lg  mt-4">
              Applied advanced javascript concepts such as composable and pure
              component features of FP to write a new library aiming to solve
              the problem caused by OOP style library, which is tightly coupled
              and became hard to maintain. The refactored version’s render speed
              was two times faster.{' '}

            <div className="indent-8 lg:text-lg">
              Performance does matter to us due to the large number of users. I
              tested our site with Lighthouse, and applied methods such as using
              reselect to memoize state, useCallback to memoize functions, lazy
              load and code splitting to reduce the initial load time, and
              minimize image size for production.

              We also chose to manipulate canvas and WebGL with pixi.js and GSAP
              library to create 2D animations. The benefits from using pixi.js
              instead of Unity are 2-3 times faster developing time and much
              smaller file size.
